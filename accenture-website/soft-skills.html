    <h2>🚀 Our Soft Skills Journey</h2>

    <div class="skills-section">
      <h3>🎤 1. How to Present</h3>
      <p>
        In our Workshop <strong>“How to present”</strong> we learned the best tips and tricks for presenting as well as how to use our body language,
         voice and confidence to our advantage.
         Afterwards we were able to test our new skills by spontaneously presenting with <a href="https://kapopo.de/">Karopop</a>.

      <h3>📝 2. How to Write a PowerPoint Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        After learning about how to present, we moved on to building a presentation by working in different phases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🗂️ Plan</li>
        <li>🧱 Structure</li>
        <li>🔧 Build</li>
        <li>🚀 Execute</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also discovered different types of presentations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ℹ️ Informative - Facts, not emotional</li>
        <li>📚 Instructional - Direct instructions to explain a concept</li>
        <li>❤️ Arousing - Emotional to raise awareness of a problem/situation</li>
        <li>💡 Persuasive - Convincing by using arguments and emotion</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="skills-section">
      <h3>📋 3. Project Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>❓ What is PM? - Structuring processes, setting project scope, goals, identifying stakeholders and risks.</li>
        <li>✅ Top Tips - KISS (Keep it simple, short), communication is key.</li>
        <li>👥 Stakeholders - Categorized by influence and interest, included in communication accordingly.</li>
        <li>⚠️ Risks - Identify, Quantify, Prioritize, Plan Response, Assign Responsibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="skills-section">
      <h3>🌍 4. Self- & Cultural Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is crucial for teamwork. Everyone must show empathy, collaborate, and self-reflect. There are 4 different social styles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>😃 Expressive</li>
        <li>🤝 Caring</li>
        <li>🧐 Analyzing</li>
        <li>💪 Pushing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cultural differences are important in global teams. Developing Self & Cultural Awareness helps us understand our coworkers better.
